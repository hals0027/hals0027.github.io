            <h4>About Me</h4>
            <p>Hi, my name is Kaila Page and I am a 19 year old student in the <abbr title= "Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program at Algonquin College. I was originally planning on joining the photography program, however it was cut the day after I found out that I had been accepted! I am now hoping to use that turn of events to educate myself further into media and design</p>
