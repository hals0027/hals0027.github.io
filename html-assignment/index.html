            <h4>About Me</h4>
            <p>Hi, my name is Kaila Page and I am a 19 year old student in the <abbr title= "Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program at Algonquin College. I was originally planning on joining the photography program, however it was cut the day after I found out that I had been accepted! It was <em>super</em> frustrating having waited for them to review my portfolio just for them to cancel the program. I am now hoping to use that turn of events to educate myself further into media and design.</p>

            <p>In my spare time, I enjoy laying in bed and watching movies, although after watching all of favourites for the 5<sup>th</sup> time, it can get a bit bland. My favourite movie of all time is Damien Chazelle's "La La Land"; I could probably watch it a thousand times and never get sick of it though! It's such a wonderful movie, and although the ending just about kills me, I think it is one of the most perfect endings in the history of cinema, and it serves as a reminder to keep chasing your dreams.</p>
